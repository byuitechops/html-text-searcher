# Requirements

### Input Requirements

#### Source of Inputs

All campus courses need this. Therefore, run it on all courses in the campus accounts. This will happen inside the tool itself, so there will be no input.

#### Definition of Inputs

None (technically I'll run a get request to get the courses which could be done by uploading a csv...but that's no fun)
